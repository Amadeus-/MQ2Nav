MQ2Nav Changelog
================


2.0.1
-----
*NOTE* This version is not compatible with navmeshes made with previous versions. You will need to rebuild your meshes!

* Revamp the Waypoints UI, fixing several bugs
  * Added option to delete and rename waypoints
  * Fixed the order of the x,y,z coordinates in waypoints UI to match /loc

* Due to changes in structure member alignment (needed to stay compatible with latest MQ2), old navmeshes will not load correctly. As a result, the navmesh compat version has been bumped up, so loading older meshes will give you an error.


2.0.0
